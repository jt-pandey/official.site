Every year big production companies lose around [$71 billion per year due to piracy](https://webhostingprof.com/blog/piracy-statistics/ "dollars"). Why not make another dent on these companies, cuz fuck these big capitalistic pigsðŸ–•. But sometimes, shit goes down and you may end up fucking yourself something like the [orborous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oroborus "snake") and get yourself [hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oroborus "fucked up"). So here's a safe and no-shit guide on how to torrent safely and enjoy everything the world has to offer.

## ![Be safe out there.](/uploads/ga-xncszfvfqhe-unsplash.jpg)

## The basics

Torrents are nothing just addresses to servers which work on the Peer-to-Peer model of data transfer commonly known as P2P protocol. You just need these addresses and use a torrent client (think of it as a web browser for browsing web). There are different and pretty efficient torrent clients out there. For computer devices, I'll prefer Deluge, Transmission or any other client like that. Try to go all Open Source for PCs, but for phones, uTorrent or BitTorrent work just fine.

It's a rather simple process, there are servers and then there are people. People act like mini servers and thus guaranteeing speed in the most remote of places and also reliability of the network.

**_Seeders:_** Seeders are all the devices which have 100% of the data, and are uploading it (known as seeding). When you complete your download, your torrent client is likely to start seeding automatically.

**_Peers:_** Peers are the devices in the _swarm_ at a given time and more the peers with better share ratio (ratio of upload and download), the better speeds. 

**_Leechers:_** People who do not seed (all of us for short).

### Where to get the .torrent files?

Good question indeed. This is the most convoluted part of piracy. There are numerous websites which offer torrent files and magnet links (just like a link for a site). But the problem is they are pretty difficult to find partly because companies are suing them for millions (of course why wouldn't they, it's billions on stake). But there still are techniques

1. **_Yify sites: _**[Yify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIFY "YIfy") is an australian company or rather it was. Their sites are the most famous because of their efficiency and light torrents. It's rather impossible to access their sites in india without VPN. yts.mx is the site where they are most active right now. 
2. **Bt4g.org:** Sites like [bt4g.org](https://bt4g.org/) and the infamous pirate bay are known as torrent aggregators as they collect torrent files and magnets and allow you to download them. 
3. **My site:** So here's a bit of self-promotion, I am going to upload torrent files soon for some movies of my very own **_JT_** collection. Be sure to check them out.

   ### Get to actual work

Now we have a torrent client and a torrent file. Since we are using a mobile device,  we just have to click on the torrent file and it automatically opens the utorrent client. That's pretty much it. It should look something like this

Now we have to wait and wait and wait.......

Now the moment the file gets to 100%, delete it from the utorrent app, but **do not tick the box which asks to delete the downloaded file too.** If you leave the utorrent app running even after downloading the file, it'll start seeding it and who wants that, right? 

That's pretty much it, double tap the back button to exit the utorrent app after deleting the torrent download(not the file).
