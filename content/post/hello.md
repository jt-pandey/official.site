# Our plan!
We'll use three things for our site:

 - Jamstack
 - [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
 - A custom domain (optional)
 
 We don't need to go into much detail, this tutorial is going to be simple and effective. We'll be using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as our static site generator here. So let's understand the basics first and feel free to leave the intro. 
 ## What the heck is jamstack!?
Jamstack is an acronym for Javascript, API and markdown.

- **Javascript** is the language in which most static site generator architecture are written. So what's this static site generator now. It's just a site making tool, makes our work simple. 
- **APIs** are **A**pplication **P**rogram **I**nterface. To make it simple, it just allows our code to talk to other code.
- **Markdown** This is simply the new generation of HTML which is simple, fast and good for us.
